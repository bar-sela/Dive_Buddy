## About:

> The main purpose of this application is to help Diving Schools to easly manage their courses, allow the divers to keep track of their diving information (sites/depth,used gear and so on).

> In our times, Diving Schools still using old notebooks to keep the student's progress, and we here to make this experience more comfortable.

> If you are new Student, you need to make a couple of dives with the instructor. Then you need to do a test and pass it in order to get your first Diving Star. Here we will keep track of each dive, the site in wich you dived, the gear you used and the depth you reached at each dive.

> The Instructors can set-up a weekly schedule, and the Student can view it in order to be updated with that information.

> In addition, we have the School Forum, in which both the Students and the Instructors can communicate with each other and get all the weekly updates.
